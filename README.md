Documentation for EXERCISE 2 â€“ WEB UI AUTOMATION

This project is composed of the below:
BDD Framework - Cucumber, 
Testing framework - Selenium, 
Model - Page object model,
Language - Java, 
Testing - jUnit,
Reporting - html reports,
logs - log4j


Project Structure:
TESTRUNNER: The execution starts from TestRunner file present under src/test/java/Cucumber.options. This file defines the location of feature files and the step definition files. In our project we have feature files designed with the tag @Regression. TESTRUNNER file runs all the scenarios in feature files tagged as @Regression. 

FEATURE FILES: Feature files are present under src/test/resources/features. These are the files which describes the features and scenarios under test. This is written in GHERKIN language which has the syntax - 'GIVEN,WHEN,THEN' to descripbe the steps of a test case.

STEPDEFINITIONS: Stepdefinition files are present under src/test/java/stepDefinitions. Every line written in a feature file under a scenario will have a java method tagged in stepdefinition file. This stepdefinitions can in turn be structured in several ways. This folder also have HOOKS.java file which will be used for executing a set of commands before and after running the testscases. Action classes implements the methods for stepdefinitions and also uses pageobject model.

OTHER FILES: The utils package has supporting classes and reusable components to perform test executions.
